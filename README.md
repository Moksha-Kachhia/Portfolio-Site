# moksha-cafe

Welcome to the repo for my personal portfolio site! This site is cafe themed since I have been nicknamed as 'mocha' many times and I also love all things coffee and matcha so I feel this theme represents me well and helps create a more welcoming atmosphere! The site features a landing page as well as experience, projects and testimonial sections! If you notice any issues with it please let me know! <3
